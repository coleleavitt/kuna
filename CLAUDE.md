# Kuna — Claude Instructions

Primary guide for this repo. `AGENTS.md` is a symlink to this file; `CLAUDE.local.md`
(git-excluded) holds the fork's build recipe and live branch state; `MEMORY.md` holds local
handoff notes. Look things up on demand via the **doc map** at the bottom — don't preload it.

## Mission
Kuna is an **agent-first decompiler written in Rust**: a decompilation engine + a SLEIGH
compiler, organized around an explicit phase model whose decision points are exposed as
per-run flippable options — **the LLM control surface is the product**. It began as a Rust
port of Ghidra's decompiler (Apache-2.0; see `LICENSE`/`NOTICE`, origin in `docs/history.md`)
and has diverged on its own defaults.

This fork (`coleleavitt/kuna`) adds **Apple support** ported from Cole's research decompiler
unlace (`~/RustProjects/active/unlace`, now research-only) plus fixes from an IDA 9.5
comparison. **Preserve** upstream's phase model, option catalog, parity gates, and speed.

## Architecture First
Each tier only builds on the ones below it; new behavior ships behind a named option.

| Path | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `decompiler/` | The engine (cargo workspace). `kuna-decomp` = the decompiler (`src/` phase-foldered `p0_knowledge/`…`p9_emit/` + `substrate/`, `infra/`); `kuna-analysis` = loader/analyzer tier (ELF/Mach-O, chained fixups, dyld cache, kernelcache, ObjC, Swift, DWARF, DEX, strings, function discovery); `kuna-sleigh`/`kuna-slacomp` = SLEIGH runtime/compiler (`slacomp`); `kuna-console` = `decomp_dbg`/`decomp_test_dbg`; `kuna-cli` = the `kuna` binary; `kuna-ghidra`/`kuna-wasm` = Ghidra and browser front-ends; `kuna-base`/`kuna-num`/`kuna-harness`/`kuna-lift-diff` = support. |
| `tests/datatests/` | Vendored XML regression corpus (675 assertions) — `make test`. |
| `tests/stages/` | kuna-owned issue testcases — `make test-stages` (`tests/stages/README.md`). |
| `tests/golden/` | Differential golden vectors for the workspace suite (`make rust-test`). |
| `specs/Ghidra/Processors/` | Vendored SLEIGH specs. `.sla` are built artifacts (gitignored), produced by `slacomp`. |
| `scripts/` + `tools/` | Python helpers + the improvement pipeline, RE-friction loop, decbench campaign drivers. |
| `integrations/` | Front-ends embedding the engine: `ghidra/` (kuna as Ghidra's decompiler core), `web/` (`kuna.noelo.org` + in-browser `decompile.run`). |

- **Apple/loader work** → `kuna-analysis`, behind a `phases.toml` option.
- **Decompiler phases P1–P9** (partition → lift/flow → dataflow → calls → types → variables →
  regions → structure → emit) + an orthogonal **P0** knowledge/config plane. Source folders
  are a taxonomy; the real pass order is `universal_sched` in
  `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/src/infra/universalaction.rs`. One-screen model: `docs/phases.md`;
  normative algorithms: `docs/spec/`.
- Decisions are flipped per run with `--option NAME VALUE`; discover them via `kuna catalog --json`.

## Current State
- Main checkout is on branch **`all`** (combined: upstream-clean PR work + the IDA-informed
  Apple tracks), public since 2026-10-31. Fork `main` mirrors upstream (PR bases) — **do not
  change `main`.** Upstream PRs (#1–#20) come from the clean `apple/*`, `fix/*`, `feat/*`
  branches, never from `all`.
- Live branch/PR state, open decisions, and session handoffs live in **`MEMORY.md`**; the
  fork build recipe and worktree layout live in **`CLAUDE.local.md`**. Read both before deep work.

## Working Rules
- **Every change that can alter emitted C ships behind a named option** — a `settableTable`
  row in `decompiler/crates/kuna-decomp/phases.toml` (all fields incl. `tier`+`symptoms`) + a
  handler in `src/p0_knowledge/kuna_option_dispatch.rs`; keep `kuna catalog --check` green.
  New logic goes in a `kuna_<slug>.rs` module in its owning phase folder (template:
  `p2_lift/kuna_loweredswitch.rs`). A pure bug fix that only corrects wrong output needs no
  flag (when in doubt, gate it). Adding an option also bumps hard-coded catalog counts
  (`kuna_phases/tests.rs`, `tests/catalog_bytecompat.rs`, `tests/stages/kuna-catalog.xml`).
- **The spec is live**: describe every feature/behavior change in prose in the owning
  `docs/spec/` chapter in the same change; run `make check-spec`.
- **Speed is a core principle**: a new default-ON must change 0/675 datatest assertions and
  pass the speed budget. Record what a default does in its `phases.toml` row + spec chapter.
- `docs/options.md` is generated: after touching option metadata,
  `decompiler/target/release/kuna catalog --markdown > docs/options.md`.
- **Never re-pin `docs/baseline.json` to hide a regression** — fix the code or make it opt-in.
  Sanctioned re-pins (upstream sync / deliberate default change) say so in the message
  (`kuna test --save-baseline`). Adding a stage test re-records `docs/baseline-stages.json`
  and bumps the corpus count in `kuna-base/src/xml.rs`.
- **Comments are rare**: file header or function header only; inline only for a genuinely
  confusing hack. New functionality → new modules matching surrounding conventions (ported
  files name methods after their C++ originals).
- kuna ElementIds use the 4000+ range; kuna PcodeOp addlflags bits start at 0x1000. Code
  comments citing `decompiler/cpp/<file>.{cc,hh}` are **upstream Ghidra anchors**, not repo paths.
- Don't commit build artifacts (`decompiler/target/`, `*.sla`). Commit at milestones with
  descriptive messages. Public auto-created things (PRs/issues/comments) start with `[AUTOMATED]`.
- **RAM guard**: stay under 90% RAM during builds/tests; if it climbs, kill the job and ask
  before retrying. No Windows-only work.
- **Worktrees**: one per agent (`../kuna-wt-<name>`); symlink this checkout's built `.sla`
  into the worktree's `specs/` (never `make specs` in a worktree); **never `git stash`**
  (`refs/stash` is shared across worktrees); build with the worktree env in `CLAUDE.local.md`
  and never set `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`.

## Validation
Only prerequisite: a Rust toolchain. Develop in the workspace; the Makefile drives builds
into `decompiler/target/release/`. The full fork build recipe (sccache/mold env, worktree
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, `PROFILE=debug`) is in **`CLAUDE.local.md`** — it overrides generic advice.

**Four gates — run all before every commit:**
```sh
make test          # datatest corpus vs docs/baseline.json      → PARITY OK 675/675
make test-stages   # stage-issue corpus vs baseline-stages.json  → PARITY OK
make rust-test     # full cargo workspace suite + options.md freshness  → green
make check-spec    # docs/spec anchors + phase-folder ownership resolve → green
make test-tools    # Python tooling unit tests (CI-required)
```
CI runs all four + `kuna catalog --check` + `make lint` (Clippy = errors in CLI/base/num) on
push to main. On a PR from a branch in this repo the workspace suite is skipped — **you are
the gate for `make rust-test`** (or add the `full-ci` label). Workspace integration tests
need built specs; missing specs are failures, not skips.

## Project Claude Layout

- `CLAUDE.local.md`: git-excluded fork mission, live branch state, and the real build recipe.
- `MEMORY.md`: local scratch/handoff state (git-ignored).
- `.claude/` (local-only): `agents/` (researcher, verifier), `commands/` (audit, repro),
  `rules/` (code-style, security, testing), `skills/kuna-apple-port/`.
