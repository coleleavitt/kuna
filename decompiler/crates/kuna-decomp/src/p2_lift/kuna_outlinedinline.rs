//! **outlinedinline** — inline clang's MachineOutliner fragments into their
//! callers.
//!
//! At `-Oz`, and in most Swift and Apple system code, clang's MachineOutliner
//! moves instruction sequences that repeat across functions into shared
//! `OUTLINED_FUNCTION_<n>` fragments and calls them with `bl` (or ends the
//! caller with a `b`). A fragment is not a function of the source: it has no
//! frame of its own, often reads and writes the caller's registers and stack,
//! and a caller split across several of them reads as a string of opaque calls
//! that hide its data flow. IDA marks them outlined by name and Hex-Rays inlines
//! them; this does the same through upstream's inline machinery: the
//! FunctionSymbol is flagged inline (what `option inline <name>` does), so flow
//! splices the fragment's body into each caller.
//!
//! Name based, like IDA: a stripped image keeps its fragments as calls.
