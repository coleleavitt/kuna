//! (kuna) `switchtrim` — recover a jump table no guard bounds, and end it where
//! its layout ends.
//!
//! A switch whose default is unreachable (`__builtin_unreachable()`, an enum
//! the compiler trusts, a `switch (x & 7)` the mask was folded out of) indexes
//! its table with no range check. `JumpBasic` then sees the full width of the
//! index, the range exceeds `jumptablemax`, and the `BRANCHIND` stays a computed
//! jump-as-call. IDA recovers these by reading the table until a stop rule
//! fires. This pass does the same: a single-`LOAD` table whose range is
//! unbounded is opened to `[0, jumptablemax)`; emulation stops at the first row
//! it cannot read, and the sanity check keeps the rows before the first one
//! that
//!
//! * is zero or far away with no image bytes behind it (upstream's rule),
//! * points into the table's own bytes (its first entry up to this one's end),
//! * is read from at or above the lowest code address an earlier row jumps to
//!   (a table cannot run into the code it dispatches to), or
//! * on an object load, points outside the image's executable memory.
//!
//! Each row must read its own entry, above the previous row's, so a range
//! opened on a value that is not the table index reads no table at all. Fewer
//! than two rows is no table.
